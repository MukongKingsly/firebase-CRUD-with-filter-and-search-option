# Concept

This small project has helped me understand how to create, read, update and delete data (CRUD) from cloud firestore provided by Firebase (Google). With this knowledge I can build any app which uses firebase as the backend

- The webapp is a phone contact app where a user creates a new user using name, email and contact.

- The homepage displays all lists of contacts available already, with a navbar search box to search for any contact by namme, link to add a new contact

- Each contact displayed on the homepage has 3 buttons; edit, delete and view. **Edit** button takes you to a page populated with the user's data already available. The **Delete** button removes data completely from the database while the **View** button takes you to a link based on the chosen contact's id
